def the goal, use image of deep model to understand vocabulary, concepts


1
neuron definition
weights, bias, input, activation


2
perceptron, hystory
JB example, one layer, linear, circle
FP example GUI fit by sigmoids. TODO

classification Vs regression ("In machine learning, regression algorithms attempt to estimate the mapping function (f) from the input variables (x) to numerical or continuous output variables (y). On the other hand, classification algorithms attempt to estimate the mapping function (f) from the input variables (x) to discrete or categorical output variables (y).")
train data normalization (classical: mn=0, std=1, without changing the stored data)

activations (categorical Vs regression): linear, relu, sigmoid, softmax
loss functions (categorical Vs regression): categorical cross-entropy, MSE, MAE, ...
intro SDG, learning rate, momentum
other optimizers (adam, amdamax, rmsprop, adagrad ...)
batch, minibatch, one point=SDG


3
hidden layers 
densely connected
vanishing gradient

JB example circle by 2 layers
FP example regression sin curve (changing n.layers, n.neurons, opimizer, TODO make it overfit)
introduce loss, validation loss
FP example classification clustering

overfitting
dropout
TODO regularization L1 L2


4
convolutional layers
relu most used
def convolution, padding, pas, max pooling

FP example mnist
JB example segmentation


5
advanced DL
recurrent NN
residual NN
generative (adversarial) NN


6
Misc
is DL supervised or unsupervised? can be both
TODO Logistic Regression
